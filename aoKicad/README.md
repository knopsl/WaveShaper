# Analog Output KiCad Libraries

KiCad symbol and footprint libraries I use all the time:

## ao_symbols.lib

Symbols include (among others):

* 1N4148, 1N5817, 2N3904, TL07x, etc. with my preferred footprints (from ao_tht) and added fields including Vendor, SKU
* C, CP, R with ao_tht footprints
* Euro/Kosmo power headers (versions with power pins and all passive)
* Vactrol

## ao_tht.pretty

Footprints include many common THT packages with revised silkscreen (both reference and value in most cases). Also:

* CC0, OSHW, and Analog Output logos
* DIN5 board mount
* DPDT and SPDT toggle switches
* Kosmo style 1/4" audio jack
* Alpha type rotary switch
* Hand soldering SOT-23 (yes, I know the library says THT)
* Some terminal blocks I use

Many of these symbols and footprints are based on versions from the KiCad distribution. Some are based on ones collected from other sources â€” I haven't kept good track of where they came from. If any are covered by licenses not compatible with CC0 please let me know.
