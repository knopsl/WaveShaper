This is a work in progress; better README to come soon. Meanwhile:

**Untested hardware and software â€” Do not assume anything works!**

Repo uses submodules aoKicad and Kosmo_panel. To clone:

```
git clone git@github.com:holmesrichards/WaveShaper.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

If desired, copy the files from aoKicad and Kosmo\_panel to wherever you prefer (your KiCad user library directory, for instance, if you have one). Then in KiCad, add symbol libraries 

```
aoKicad/ao_symbols
Kosmo_panel/Kosmo
```
and footprint libraries 
```
aoKicad/ao_tht
Kosmo_panel/Kosmo_panel.
```
