This is a work in progress; better README to come soon. Meanwhile:

**Untested hardware and software â€” Do not assume anything works!**

Repo uses submodules aoKicad and Kosmo_panel. To clone:

```
git clone git@github.com:holmesrichards/WaveShaper.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
```


Alternatively do

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:holmesrichards/WaveShaper.git
```

Or if you download the repository as a zip file, you must also click on the "aoKicad" and "Kosmo\_panel" links on the GitHub page (they'll have "@ something" after them) and download them as separate zip files which you can unzip into this repo's aoKicad and Kosmo\_panel directories.

If desired, copy the files from aoKicad and Kosmo\_panel to wherever you prefer (your KiCad user library directory, for instance, if you have one). Then in KiCad, add symbol libraries 

```
aoKicad/ao_symbols
Kosmo_panel/Kosmo
```
and footprint libraries 
```
aoKicad/ao_tht
Kosmo_panel/Kosmo_panel.
```
